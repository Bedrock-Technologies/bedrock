      "question": "What is this project?",
      "answer": "At this current time, Home Suite Home is a project that has been born out of wanting to make my Colony home feel, well, more like my home. In its most basic state, it is right now to be enjoyed & placed in your Galactic Gridz Colony address to make it look better. This mint is a test run of the community sentiment towards the project & artwork, after privately showcasing the collection and was repeatedly asked to make it available. If the community is pro what has been created, there is a planned-out continuation of the project that could end with your own built out terra home. I hope you enjoy the pieces as much as I enjoyed spending a lot of hours creating them."
